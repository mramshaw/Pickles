# Pickles

Experiments in pickling (data serialization) in Golang and Python.

## Motivation

Parsing input data for machine learning is a time-intensive process.

It's a recommended practice to serialize this data (pickle it) so as
to reduce the overhead of continually processing input data - especially
for static datasets.

For a number of reasons, machine learning is normally carried out
in Python. But as I was trying out
[Golang for machine learning](http://github.com/mramshaw/gophernet) 
it seemed like a good idea to look into pickling and whether or not
it could be done in a language-agnostic way.

## Python options

Basically, there's `pickle`:

    http://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html

There are other options but the use of `pickle` is pretty widespread.

If the intention is a solution that is language-agnostic, it
is probably a good idea (for compatibility reasons) to avoid
specifying `protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` as this may result
in the use of an unsupported format. That said, it is probably
a good idea to use the highest language-agnostic format (i.e. 2)
as it seems to support more datatypes than earlier versions.

Note that the __default__ protocol is __3__ (which is a Python 3
format).

If performance is a concern (when is it not?) then there is
`cPickle`:

    http://pymotw.com/2/pickle/

> The `cPickle` module implements the same algorithm, in C instead of Python. It is many times faster than the Python implementation, but does not allow the user to subclass from Pickle. If subclassing is not important for your use, you probably want to use cPickle.

#### Other options

Other options are as follows:

* [msgpack](http://pypi.org/project/msgpack-python/)
* [HDF5](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/quick.html)
* [dill](http://pypi.org/project/dill/)
* [cloudpickle](http://pypi.org/project/cloudpickle/)
* [anycache](http://pypi.org/project/anycache/)

## Golang options

There are options for storing data in Golang, listed below.

#### Golang-only options

For storing binary data with Golang:

    http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/

I would be very surprised if this format supported compression well.

#### Pickles options

For reading & writing pickled data with Golang there is `og贸rek`:

    https://godoc.org/github.com/kisielk/og-rek

According to the docs, it is safe:

> In particular on Go side it is thus by default safe to decode pickles from untrusted sources(^).

As `og贸rek` supports Protocol 3 (the Python 3 variety), as wellas being able to ___write___ pickles, it is probably the package of choice:

```Golang
e := og贸rek.NewEncoderWithConfig(w, &og贸rek.EncoderConfig{
	Protocol: 3,
})
err := e.Encode(obj)
```

Of course, for reading pickled data with Golang there is also `stalecucumber`:

    http://godoc.org/github.com/hydrogen18/stalecucumber

Note that `stalecucumber` only supports Python 2 pickle formats:

> Protocols 0,1,2 are implemented. These are the versions written by the Python 2.x series. Python 3 defines newer protocol versions, but can write the older protocol versions so they are readable by this package.

As far as I can tell, the higher the version number, the
more compression is applied. For the best compression, it
is probably necessary to use Python 3.

There are examples on the GitHub repo:

    http://github.com/hydrogen18/stalecucumber

There is a good writeup on this package here:

    http://www.hydrogen18.com/blog/reading-pickled-data-in-go.html

If you are planning on using `pickle` this article is well worth a read
as it gives useful information on the internals of the `pickle` format.
Note however the following:

> In the future, I plan on adding to the library the writing of pickled objects from Go.

## Language-agnostic options

There is `protobuf` (although I am not sure how well Python supports it):

    http://github.com/golang/protobuf

Probably the best approach is to use the `pickle` format.

## To Do

- [ ] Investigate Golang serialization formats (gob)
- [ ] Investigate whether or not compression is a good idea (probably)
- [ ] Investigate Python support for `protobuf`
